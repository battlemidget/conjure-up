* `name, version, summary, excerpt, maintainer` are pretty self explanatory
* `bundles`: A list of key/value items describing what bundles are available for the installed package.
  * `key`: **required** This references the key name of the bundle usually found at the end of the charmstore URL
  * `name`: **required** Friendly name to display in selection view
  * `summary`: **required** Short summary of what the bundle does
  * `blacklist`: **optional** A list of providers to blacklist, if defined it will show all providers but those specified here.
  * `whitelist`: **optional** Opposite of `blacklist` if defined will only show these providers and hide the others.
  * `recommendedCharms`: **optional** A list of of recommended charms that would be useful for the bundle.
  * `additionalQuestions`: **optional** List of additional questions a bundle would require for deployment.
  * `bootstrapSeries`: **optional** Distro series of bootstrap controller
  * `location`: **optional** Charmstore URL or local filepath of the bundle location

## Additional Questions

In order to define specific questions that should be answered for a particular bundle to work out of the box this section
allows you to define those and their types.

A list of supported types are:

* boolean - true/false input
* string - basic string input
* password - masked password string input
* integer - integer input

The *key* is what will be displayed to the user during input requests. Each key will then be exposed via enviroment variables
to be used in pre, post-bootstrap, and post processing tasks.

There are transformations on the key that will take place before being exported to the environment:

* Any keys with a hyphen '-' in its name will be replaced with an underscore '_'.
* All keys will be converted to UPPERCASE when exposed in the environment.

For example, a key with the name 'i-am-a-test' will be converted to 'I_AM_A_TEST' when exported.
